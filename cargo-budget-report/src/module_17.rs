//! Bitwise utility functions used by the budget-report internals.
//!
//! These helpers handle low-level bit manipulation tasks such as:
//! - Rounding values up to the nearest power of two (for size alignment).
//! - Packing and unpacking multiple small resource counters into a single `u64`
//!   for compact on-disk or in-memory storage.
//! - Testing whether a value is a power of two (common pre-condition for
//!   alignment-sensitive operations).
//! - Extracting bit flags that encode which resource categories were measured
//!   during simulation.
//!
//! Each function includes inline comments that explain the intent of every
//! bitwise operation, referencing well-known patterns where applicable.

/// Returns the smallest power of two greater than or equal to `n`.
///
/// When `n` is zero the function returns 1, matching the convention used in
/// many allocators: the smallest allocation is a single unit.
///
/// # Bitwise strategy
///
/// 1. Subtract 1 so that an exact power of two (e.g. 8 → 7 → `0b111`) does
///    not round up to the next power.
/// 2. Propagate the highest set bit to all lower bit positions so that every
///    bit below the most significant one becomes 1 (e.g. `0b0101_1000` →
///    `0b0111_1111`).
/// 3. Add 1 to obtain the next power of two (`0b0111_1111 + 1` →
///    `0b1000_0000`).
///
/// This is the standard bit-twiddling "round up to power of two" algorithm.
/// It works for any `u64` value, returning 0 on overflow (wrapping)
/// when `n > 2^63` — the caller should check for that if it matters.
